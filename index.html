                <h2>Cowboys & Zombies?</h2>
                <p>While Hunt is yet another FPS - there are a few things that
                    take it to the next level & make it my favorite video game.
                    The setting is late 1800s in the Lousiana bayous, zombies have 
                    infested the world & monsters roam freely.

            <section>
                <p>Hunt has zombies, monsters of all types, and even 'bosses' that you
                    must slay and then loot their bounty then extract safely.
                </p>
                <h2>PvP & PvE?</h2>

                <p>Not only zombies though, there are other Hunters on the map.
                    Hunters are enemy players also vying for their chance at the loot!

                <h2>Friendship & Camaraderie</h2>
                <p>My absolute favorite aspect of Hunt is the community. I've met
                    some of the most fantastic folks in the harsh bayou, and 
                    had many a friendship grow stronger. It's a fun place, despite the
                    horror-style theme!
